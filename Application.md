# Layer 7: Application Layer

## What It Is:
**The apps you actually use** - web browsers, email, messaging apps.
The Application Layer is the **only layer that directly interacts with users**. When you check email, browse a website, or use a messaging app, you're working at Layer 7.
Think of this layer as the **"face" of the network** - it's what you see and interact with.

### Real World Example:
**Ordering food delivery:**
- **You** using the UberEats app = Application Layer
- **You don't care** about how the order gets to the restaurant
- **You just want** to see the menu and place your order

---

### What It Does:
1. Lets you interact with network services
2. Examples: Chrome (web), Outlook (email), Slack (chat)
3. **Does NOT** include the actual data transmission

---

### Simple Test:
Are you **clicking, typing, or viewing** something in an app?  
✅ That's the Application Layer.

---

**Next:** Once you've placed your order, it needs to be packaged properly.
