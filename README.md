# The OSI Model: A Beginner's Guide

**Author:** Alex Le
**Last Updated:** December 2025

## Purpose & Content
This tutorial provides a simple, conceptual introduction to the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model, a fundamental framework for understanding how data travels across a network. We'll break down each of its seven layers in plain language, using analogies. You won't find complex configurations here—just a clear explanation of *what* the model is and *why* it matters.

## Target Audience
This tutorial is designed for:
* **Absolute beginners** in networking, IT, or computer science.
* Students or hobbyists with **little to no prior knowledge** of network concepts.
* Anyone who has heard terms like "Layer 2" or "Application Layer" and wants a friendly, high-level understanding.
* The content is aimed at a **high school reading level** and above.

Think of sending a text message to a friend:

1. **You type the message** (Layer 7 - Application)
2. **Phone encrypts it** (Layer 6 - Presentation) 
3. **Phone connects to friend** (Layer 5 - Session)
4. **Message gets broken into pieces** (Layer 4 - Transport)
5. **Pieces get addresses** (Layer 3 - Network)
6. **Sent to the right Wi-Fi** (Layer 2 - Data Link)
7. **Travels as radio waves** (Layer 1 - Physical)

The OSI Model is just 7 steps that happen whenever devices talk to each other.

### Remember This:
**"All People Seem To Need Data Processing"**
A - Application (Layer 7)
P - Presentation (Layer 6)
S - Session (Layer 5)
T - Transport (Layer 4)
N - Network (Layer 3)
D - Data Link (Layer 2)
P - Physical (Layer 1)

### Why It Matters:
- **Troubleshooting**: If your internet isn't working, which "step" broke?
- **Understanding**: Helps you get how networks actually work
- **Communication**: Tech people use these terms all the time

**Next:** Let's start at the top with Layer 7 - where you actually use apps!
